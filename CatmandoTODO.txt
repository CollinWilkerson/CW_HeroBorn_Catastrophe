detection nonsense
I am currently able to tell when the player is in the enemies sight lines.
keeping it simple, I can increase a float each frame the player is inside the enemy sightlines, and increase it a lot when the plr shoots
Enemies that detect the player, but don't fill the float will go to the player's last detected location.
Fully aware enemies will continue to follow the player even if they exit detection and sightlines
when the player is outside of the detection radius the float will decrease
